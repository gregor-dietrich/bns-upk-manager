Removing Character Animations &amp; Effects in Blade &amp; Soul
* USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
* Repair/Scan game files via NC Launcher always undoes whatever you break
* Open settings.json with any text editor, such as Notepad(++)
* If there is no settings.json (yet), run the .exe file!

## Profile Management
* Rename, then Copy&Paste a settings.json to /profiles/ to switch between settings
* (Menu entries for this feature are only generated if profiles are present!)
* The upcoming GUI will make this a lot more user-friendly
